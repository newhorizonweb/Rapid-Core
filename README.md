## Settings

The player can modify key game elements, including:
- Game time duration (10s, 30s, 60s)
- Gameplay audio (core click, miss sounds, etc.)
- Music audio (change track, pasue, mute, etc.)

Once the start button is pressed, the game duration buttons will be disabled. They will be re-enabled after the game has ended.

The music will start automatically when the first game preparation timer ends.
Players have the option to mute gameplay sounds or music at any point.

## Gameplay

After initiating the start of the game, there will be a 3-second preparation timer.
The main objective is to shoot down as many cores as possible in the set timeframe.
Elements below the game field indicate the player's score and the remaining time.

The player can't resize the browser window, as it would be considered cheating and the game would be terminated immediately.
If the player decides that they want to finish the game early, they can click the "finish" button below the game field.

If the game is terminated for one of the reasons mentioned above or the player get's a score of 0, the results won't be saved to the statistics.
